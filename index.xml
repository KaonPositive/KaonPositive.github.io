Reading Chapter 6: Name Resolution and Scoping List of what can be named in a program:
 Variables (local/global) and parameters Procedures/Functions/Methods/Sub-routines Modules/Packages Classes Fields Program locations (labels) Types and Structures  Activation Records All code runs in a data context (a state)&amp;ndash;the context is the data associated w/ the running code. The data associated is typically the state of parameters and the local variables; the state associated w/ an object is kept in dynamically allocated blocks of memory on the heap.</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes Reading Chapter 5 Parse Trees Parse Trees ( sometimes referred to as Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) ) are used as an internal representation of a sourced program (recall that the parser generates a parse-tree representation of the correctly parsed program).
A parse tree preserves rules for associativity, commutativity, and precedence as defined by the grammar.
A parse tree consists of two different kinds of nodes:
 Internal Nodes - correspond to nonterminals from the grammar Leaf Nodes - correspond to the terminals of the grammar as found in the parsed source program.</description>

      <description>Lecture NOTE: For the log function, the reason as to why we are adding 1 to r is due to the fact that if log(0), then it would be undefined.
Recall from last lecture (Intensity Transformation): Formula for intensity transformation (or point processing): $s = T(r)$
Formula for Image Negatives: $s = (L-1)-r$
Formula for Log Transformation: $s = clog(1 + r)$
Power Law (Gamma) Transformation Formula is: $ s = cr^\gamma $ or $ s = c(r + \epsilon)^\gamma$ for $c &amp;gt; 0$ and $\gamma &amp;gt; 0$ and s and r are scaled to $[0, 1]$</description>

      <description>Lecture Histogram A histogram plots how many times (frequency) each intensity value in an image occurs.
Histogram Equalization It produces a transformation function to generate an output image w/ a uniform histogram.
Histogram equalization in DIP can be categorized into two types:
 Discrete - Is the standard in digital image processing. Intensity levels of pixels are discrete values Continuous - Used in theory and simulations. Data not limited to a set of discrete values&amp;ndash;value can be within a range.</description>

      <description>Lecture Spatial Filtering It is a technique for modifying/enhancing images by manipulating the value of each pixel based on its own value and the values of surrounding neighbors.
In terms of digital image processing, a filter is a predefined matrix known as a kernel/mask/template/window.
 NOTE: the matrix will determine how to integrate a pixel w/ its neighbors to generate a new pixel value.
 Depending on the intended effect of an image, filters will vary in size, shape, and the values that they contain.</description>

Spatial Operations Set of operations include:
 Single-pixel Neighborhood Geometric  Difference between intensity transformation and spatial filtering
 Intensity Transformation - it is point-based&amp;ndash;affects each pixel independently. Spatial Filtering - neighborhood-based&amp;ndash;considers the surrounding pixels.  Intensity transformations It is also known as point processing The purpose of intensity transformations is to modify pixels values to enhance the image.
The transformation is independent of locations&amp;ndash;determined only by the intensity values.</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes RECALL: A Parser&amp;rsquo;s job is to make sure if the program is syntactically correct.
Types of Parsers:
 LL(k) - First L says to scan from Left to Right; Second L says to use left-most derivation (always develop the left-most non-terminal in a sentential form).   NOTE: A good thing about a LL(k) parser is that it is linear&amp;ndash;there is no backtracking.
 LR(k) - First L says to scan from Left to Right; Second R says to use reverse right-most derivation (start w/ input string, find appropriate grammar rule, then start at the right).</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes Images can be represented as:
 Surface in a 3D space Visual Intensity Array 2D Numerical Array  Representing Digital Images: Consider a continuous image with a function $f(s, t)$ Through sampling and quantization, the digital image will then be $f(x, y)$
Formula to get the coordinates of the center of the image: $(x_c, y_c) = (floor(M/2), floor(N/2))$
Two types of different image resolutions:
  Spatial Resolution (1920 x 1080) - is determined how fine/coarse the image is (ex: low spatial resolution would result in jagged lines; think of pixelated alphabets/sharp images).</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes 1/22 Rules for a Regular Expression:
if s &amp;amp; t are regular expressions, then:
 s | t s * t (concatenate) s*  ( continued from last lecture ) NFA for recognizing tokens construct NFAs for each construct of a Regular Expression.
If all tokens of a language are represented by regular expressions $r_1, r_2, r_3, &amp;hellip; r_n$, then we can create $N(r_1), N(r_2), &amp;hellip; N(r_n)$.
NFA is classified somewhat as a greedy algorithm.</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes What is Digital Image Processing? Image - a 2D function f(x,y) where x and y represent the coordinates. f would be the amplitude for the given coordinates x and y.
 NOTE: the 2D function f(x,y) (amplitude) is called the intensity/gray level of the image.
 An image is considered a digital image when x, y, and intensity of values are all finite and discrete.
 NOTE: for an analog image: x, y, and intensity of values are continuous.</description>

      <description>Goal for Machine Learning The goal for machine learning is to help us make decisions with or without human supervision. To achieve this, machine learning uses a group of algorithms/methodologies to discover and formulate repeatable patterns in data.
Unsupervised Learning An algorithm that detects and utilizes data that are not generated randomly, therefore it finds patterns/structure within the data to comprehend it.
 Laymen&amp;rsquo;s Terms: Non-randomly generated data is read and the algorithm will detect certain patterns within the data to better understand it.</description>

Is a discriminative classification algorithm that has the form $P(y|x, \theta)$ where $X\in R^D$ (basically, it&amp;rsquo;s continuous and D-dimensional).
 NOTE: Logistic Regression can use categorical inputs. Naive Bayes is a generative algorithm.
 If output size is:
 C = 2, then it is classified as binary logistic regression. C &amp;gt; 2, then it is classified as multi-class logistic regression.  Binary Logistic Regression $P(y|x, \theta)$ = Ber$( y|\mu(x))$</description>

      <description>Important terms:
 Comparison-based Sorting: Sort elements by comparing them with each other. Non-comparison-based Sorting: Sorts do NOT compare elements with one another.  Selection Sort Is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
You basically iterate through the array and find the smallest/largest element. If the smallest/largest element is found, exchange it with the first element. Keep doing this until you reach at the end of list.
TLDR; Find smallest element and exchange it with element in the first position; find the second smallest element and exchange it in the second position, etc.</description>

That will indicate whether the item is found or not).
For example, you can implement a sparse array with memos. With these memos, you have pairs (i, A[i]) where i is the query and A[i] is the collection of items/data of said query.</description>

      <description>Kruskal&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm It is a greedy algorithm that gives an optimal solution for a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
Steps to solve Kruskal&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm:
 Sort graph edges in nondecreasing order (from least to greatest). Then, starting with an empty subgraph, it scans the sorted list which adds the next edge on the list to the current subgraph IF it does NOT create a cycle. If the edge does create a cycle, simply just skip it.</description>

      <description>Recurrences It describes a sequence of numbers. For instance, an example of a recurrence would be: $T_1 = 1$ $T_n = T_{n-1}+1$ for n &amp;gt;= 2
 They are useful to analyze the performance of recursive algorithms
 Anti-Derivative Method Formula is: $f&#39;(x) = \lim_{h-&amp;gt;0}\frac{f(x)-f(x-h)}{h}$
 In terms of asymptotic analysis, in this case, we only need h to be &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo; to zero but still positive. NOTE: h must be smaller than x.</description>

      <description>What are Context-Free Languages? It is a collection of languages that are associated with context-free grammars.
 Includes all regular languages and many additional languages.  Context-Free Grammars It is a 4-tuple where (V, $\sum$, R, S), where:
 V is a finite set called the variables. Is uppercase. $\sum$ is a finite set, disjoint from V, called terminals. Is lowercase. R is a finite set of rules, with each rule being a variable and a string of variables and terminals $S \in V$ is the start variable  What is a derivation?</description>

      <description>Djiksta&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm You are given a start vetex $s$, and it finds the shortest path from $s$ to every other vertex in the graph, including your desired destination $t$.
 Shortest Path does not necessarily mean it is the fastest path; it means that the path has the least number of segments (edges).
 Steps for Djikstra&amp;rsquo;s:
 Find the cheapest node starting from the source/start vertex. Update the costs of the neighbors of this node.</description>

      <description>Entropy It is the measure of uncertainty in a probability distribution.
Formula: $\mathbb{H}(x) = -\sum_k^kP(X=k)*logp(X=k)$
Gross Entropy Gross Entropy of two distributions P and Q is given by: $\mathbb{H}(p,q) = -\sum_{k=1}^kP_k*log(q_k)$
 Gross Entropy is used as log loss in binary classification.
 Generate Classifier $P(y = c|x, \theta) \alpha P(x|y = c, \theta)P(y=c | \theta)$
 NOTE: Alpha means proportional
 Difference between Discrimitive and Generative Classifiers  Discrimitive Classifier finds a boundry that separates the two classes.</description>

      <description>What is a Regular Expression? It is a way of denoting/describing languages. EX: $(0{\cup}1)0^*$ is an example of a regular expression. Says that the language starts with a 0 or a 1 followed by any number of 0s.
Rules for regular expression:
 Empty set ${\empty}$ is a regular expression and denotes language ${\empty}$. Empty string ${\lambda}$ is a regular expression denoting set {${\lambda}$}. Each alphabet a is a regular expression and denotes the set {${a}$}.</description>

      <description>What is Supervised Learning? Function that perfectly maps each input to its output.
 Supervised Learning Algorithms work with input-output pairs!
 f* &amp;lt;- model&amp;rsquo;s approximation x (bold lowercase) = input vector y = output (typically scalar unless output is multi-dimensional)
What is a model parameter? Variable which can be estimatted by fitting given data to model.
 ex: $f(x) = mx+c$, where x = independent variable, c = dependent   m and c are parameters.</description>

      <description>Statistics The task of estimating the parameters ($\theta$) from the training data is called training\model fitting.
$\hat{\theta} = argmin L ({\theta})$
 $\hat{\theta}$ = estimated parameter $L = $ Loss Function (aka objective/cost function)  argmin $f(\theta)$ returns $\theta$ that minimizes $L(\theta)$. Ex: argmin $x^2$ = 0
Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) Refers to finding parameters that maximizes one likelihood of training data. It is the most common approach to parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>Probability Probability quantifies uncertainty.
 Probability is between 0 and 1.
 P(A): Probability that the event A will occur.
 0 &amp;lt;= P(A) &amp;lt;= 1  P(${A&#39;}$): Probability that the event A will NOT occur.
 $0 &amp;lt;= P({A^c}) &amp;lt;= 1$ $P(A) + P({A^c}) = 1$ $P({A^c}) = 1 - P(A)$  Joint Probability Define probability of two events occuring at the same time. ${P(A \cap B}) = P(A, B)$</description>

      <description>What is Unsupervised Learning? It is a learning model where it is trained ONLY on the inputs.
 REMEMBER: Supervised learning uses input-output pairs to parameterize the model for improvement.
  Ex of Unsupervised Learning: Music recommendations by using clusters of users that have similar music taste.  What is Clustering? No classification exists to determine data clusters. Therefore, it is a challenge to separate data in their respective classes/groups.</description>

      <description>$ {y_n} = f({x_n})$ where $f$ is the fuction we assume exist and try to approximate.
$ \hat{y_n} = f^({x_n})$ where $ \hat{y_n} $ is the prediction and $ f^ $ is the model&amp;rsquo;s approximation.
If we try to get comparisons for a data instance, we try to find the best line that fits the data instance the best.
 Ex: you will prefer a function over another function since data is closests to it.</description>

      <description>What is Machine Learning? By definition from Tom Mitchell:
 A computer program is learning form experience E w/ respect to some class of tasks T, and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves w/ experience E.
 Breaking it down into simple terms&amp;hellip;
 You improve over tasks T.   Ex: Predicting the price of the house in the market.  W/ repect to some performance P   Ex: How much the house is sold for.</description>

      <description>What is time complexity?   It is the measure of how long an algorithm will run as the size of the input increases&amp;ndash;this examines the proportional time of the largest components of the algorithm.
 Proportional Time: Only being mindful of the running-time of an input of size n, NOT the running-time for a specific input. Example:  int sum{}; for( const auto i : arr ) if( num % 2 == 0 ) sum += num; return sum;  Note: In this example, the loop will iterate the entire array once, so it runs directly proportional to n (linear run time).</description>

      <description>What is a data structure?  Used for organization and modification of data.  What are the two types of data structures?  Linear: Elements result in a sequence or linear list. Examples: arrays, linked lists, stacks, etc. Non-linear: Traversal of nodes is not done in a sequential manner. Examples: trees, graphs, etc.  What is an array?  A collection of the same data type that are stored at contiguous memory locations (memory locations are adjacent to each other in memory).</description>
