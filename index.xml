      <description>Content Types This theme supports two types of content types: post and page. To specify them, you need to add them in your markdown metadata.
Post This is the default blog post type which will be shown in your &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; section and who&amp;rsquo;s tags will be indexed. Basically, a normal blog post.
--- title: &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; date: 2021-01-01 description: &amp;#34;A blog post&amp;#34; image: &amp;#34;/path/to/image.png&amp;#34; type: &amp;#34;post&amp;#34; tags: [&amp;#34;blog&amp;#34;] --- # Hello World!</description>

      <description>Supervised Learning continued&amp;hellip;  x $ {\in} $ X (capital X is the input space) y $ {\in} $ Y (capital Y is the output space)   Basically, the input space is the set of possible inputs; output space is the set of possible outputs.
  D = {(${x_n}, {y_n}$)}${_n}^{N}$ is the set of all input-output pairs.  N is the dataset size and D is script D.</description>

      <description>What are Individuals/subjects/objects? They are units described by a set of data.
 These units can be people, things, animals, companies, etc. They are actual nouns.
  Examples of individuals/subjects/objects: Freshman students, companies, cells, etc.  What are variables? They are characteristics of individuals/subjects/objects. They can either be qualitative or quantitative (categorical)
 Quantitative: can be counted (number of things)  Ex: age (in years), length (in m), number of children, etc.</description>

      <description>What is Machine Learning? By definition from Tom Mitchell:
 A computer program is learning form experience E w/ respect to some class of tasks T, and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves w/ experience E.
 Breaking it down into simple terms&amp;hellip;
 You improve over tasks T.   Ex: Predicting the price of the house in the market.  W/ repect to some performance P   Ex: How much the house is sold for.</description>

      <description>Types of Running Time:  O(n) - Worst-case Running Time   f(n) = O(g(n)) Grows no faster than n Describes the upper bound It is the maximum number of steps taken in any instance of size n&amp;ndash;calculates the maximum time an algorithm takes to complete execution. Formal Definition of O(n):  f(n) &amp;lt;= c*g(n) for all n &amp;gt;= n0 where n0 can be some number greater than 0 and c is some constant Ex: f(n) = 2n + 3; g(n) = n 2n + 3 &amp;lt;= 10n, which is true    $ \Omega $(n) - Best-case Running Time   f(n) = $ \Omega $(g(n)) Grows at least as fast as n Describes the lower bound Calculates the shortest time an algorithm takes to complete execution Formal Definition of $ \Omega $(n):  f(n) &amp;gt;= c*g(n) for all n &amp;gt;= n0 where n0 can be some number greater than 0 and c is some constant    $ \Theta $(n) - Expected-case Running Time   f(n) = $ \Theta $(g(n)) Means both $ \Omega $(n) and O(n) Gives the average bound (expresses lower and upper bound of algorithm&amp;rsquo;s run time).</description>

      <description>What is an alphabet?  It is a non-empty finite set of symbols. Ex:  $\Sigma$ = {0,1} $\Sigma$ = {a, b, c} $\Sigma$ = {a, b, c, &amp;hellip; z}    What is a string?  It is a finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet. Ex: $\Sigma$ = {a, b, c}  w1 = &amp;ldquo;abc&amp;rdquo; - This is a string of 3 symbols. w2 = &amp;ldquo;acaba&amp;rdquo; - This is a string of 5 symbols.</description>

      <description>Integration by Parts Guidelines for selecting u and dv:   Remember &amp;ldquo;L-I-A-T-E&amp;rdquo; where you choose &amp;ldquo;u&amp;rdquo; to be the function that comes first in the list.
 L - Logrithmic Function I - Inverse Trig Function A - Algebraic Function T - Trig Function E - Exponential Function   Example:     Alternative Guidelines for Choosing u and dv:
 dv is the complicated portion of the integrand that can easily be integrated.</description>

      <description>What is a binary tree? It is a recursive, non-linear tree data structure where one node is designated as the root and the others are called the children of the root. Each node has AT MOST two children.
What does each node have?  Each node in the tree must have:  Data: Holds the value/data of the associated node Pointer to the left child Pointer to the right child.    C++ Code Example:</description>

      <description>What is a linked-list?  It is a non-contiguous linear data structure where a sequence of nodes are connected to one another via a reference pointer. Each node stores the data and address of the next node.  What does each node have?  A node in a linked-list typically have two components:  Data: Holds the value/data of the associated node Next Pointer: Stores memory address (reference pointer) of the next node in the sequence Head and Tail: The head node will be the way to access the linked list&amp;ndash;it points to the first node of the list.</description>

      <description>What is an algorithm?  Sequence of steps that transform input into output.  What is time complexity of an algorithm?  Indicates total time needed by program to run to completion. Expressed by using Big O notation.  What are the types of notation used for time complexity?  Big Oh: Fewer than or same as iterations. Big Omega: More than or same as iterations. Big Theta: Same as iterations.</description>

      <description>What is Abstract Factory?  Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  What is an Adapter?  Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise because of incompatibility interfaces.  What is a Bridge?  Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can very independetly.  What is a builder?</description>

      <description>What is time complexity?   It is the measure of how long an algorithm will run as the size of the input increases&amp;ndash;this examines the proportional time of the largest components of the algorithm.
 Proportional Time: Only being mindful of the running-time of an input of size n, NOT the running-time for a specific input. Example:  int sum{}; for( const auto i : arr ) if( num % 2 == 0 ) sum += num; return sum;  Note: In this example, the loop will iterate the entire array once, so it runs directly proportional to n (linear run time).</description>

      <description>What is a data structure?  Used for organization and modification of data.  What are the two types of data structures?  Linear: Elements result in a sequence or linear list. Examples: arrays, linked lists, stacks, etc. Non-linear: Traversal of nodes is not done in a sequential manner. Examples: trees, graphs, etc.  What is an array?  A collection of the same data type that are stored at contiguous memory locations (memory locations are adjacent to each other in memory).</description>
