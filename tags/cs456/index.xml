      <description>Related Question: How do you know the given DFA has the smallest number of states?
 Often more than one DFA can be there that recognize the same language.  DFA Minimization Algorithm:  Construct a table being indexed by non-final and final states.   Mark all non-final and final pairs (each pair does not have to be connected to one another; as long as they are non-final and final pairs).</description>

      <description>What is a Regular Expression? It is a way of denoting/describing languages. EX: $(0{\cup}1)0^*$ is an example of a regular expression. Says that the language starts with a 0 or a 1 followed by any number of 0s.
Rules for regular expression:
 Empty set ${\empty}$ is a regular expression and denotes language ${\empty}$. Empty string ${\lambda}$ is a regular expression denoting set {${\lambda}$}. Each alphabet a is a regular expression and denotes the set {${a}$}.</description>

      <description>What is a Finite State Machine/Finite Automata? What is a Power-Set? Power set of ${2^s}$ of set s is the set of all subsets of S. Examples: ${S_1} = $ {a, b} ${2^{S_1}} = $ {{a}, {b}, {ab}, {0}} ${2^2} = 4$ total elements
${S_2} = $ {a, b, c} ${2^{S_2}} = $ {{0}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}, {a,b,c}, } ${2^3} = 8$ total elements
What are features of deterministic accepters?</description>

      <description>What is an alphabet?  It is a non-empty finite set of symbols. Use ${\Sigma}$ to denote the alphabet. Ex:  $\Sigma$ = {0,1} $\Sigma$ = {a, b, c} $\Sigma$ = {a, b, c, &amp;hellip; z}    What is a string?  It is a finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet. Ex: $\Sigma$ = {a, b, c}  w1 = &amp;ldquo;abc&amp;rdquo; - This is a string of 3 symbols.</description>
