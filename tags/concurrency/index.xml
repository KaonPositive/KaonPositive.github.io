      <description>CUDA Programming on Jetson Nano Purpose of CUDA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is used for parallel computing on CUDA-enabled GPUs.
Architecture CPU is meant for sequential execution of instructions GPU is meant for parallel execution of control logic.
By using CUDA&amp;rsquo;s parallel processing feature, it breaks down tasks into thousands of smaller threads that can be executed independently&amp;ndash;this would lead to higher efficiency and parallelism.
TLDR: Basically, CUDA allows parallel processing of tasks to speed their applications by using GPU accelerators.</description>
