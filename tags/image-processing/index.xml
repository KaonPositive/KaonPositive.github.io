      <description>Lecture NOTE: For the log function, the reason as to why we are adding 1 to r is due to the fact that if log(0), then it would be undefined.
Power Law (Gamma) Transformation Formula is: $ s = cr^\gamma $ or $ s = c(r + \epsilon)^\gamma$ for $c &amp;gt; 0$ and $\gamma &amp;gt; 0$ and s and r are scaled to $[0, 1]$
Conditions to consider:
 If $\gamma &amp;lt; 1$: Enhance dark areas If $\gamma &amp;gt; 1$: Enhance bright areas If $\gamma = c = 1$: Identity transformation  Application that use Power Law (Gamma) Transformation</description>

      <description>Lecture NOTE: QUIZ ON MONDAY FEB 5
Spatial Operations Set of operations include:
 Single-pixel Neighborhood Geometric  Difference between intensity transformation and spatial filtering
 Intensity Transformation - it is point-based&amp;ndash;affects each pixel independently. Spatial Filtering - neighborhood-based&amp;ndash;considers the surrounding pixels.  Intensity transformations is also known as point processing The transformation is independent of locations&amp;ndash;determined only by the intensity values. Intensity transformation can be denoted by the formula: $s = T(r)$ where: s is the transformed; r is the original pixel</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes Images can be represented as:
 Surface in a 3D space Visual Intensity Array 2D Numerical Array  Representing Digital Images: Consider a continuous image with a function $f(s, t)$ Through sampling and quantization, the digital image will then be $f(x, y)$
Formula to get the coordinates of the center of the image: $(x_c, y_c) = (floor(M/2), floor(N/2))$
Two types of different image resolutions:
  Spatial Resolution (1920 x 1080) - is determined how fine/coarse the image is (ex: low spatial resolution would result in jagged lines; think of pixelated alphabets/sharp images).</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes Why studying the human eye is important:
 Mimicking visual processes Image interpretation and design Quality Color Processing Avoiding Artifacts Human-Computer Interaction  Key Components of the Eye:
 Lens and Muscles - Focuses light onto the retina Retina - Contains photoreceptors cells (rods and cones). It is a light-sensitive layer that is in the back of the eye. Rods and cones are essentially the &amp;lsquo;sensors&amp;rsquo; that receive the light.</description>

      <description>Lecture Notes What is Digital Image Processing? Image - a 2D function f(x,y) where x and y represent the coordinates. f would be the amplitude for the given coordinates x and y.
 NOTE: the 2D function f(x,y) (amplitude) is called the intensity/gray level of the image.
 An image is considered a digital image when x, y, and intensity of values are all finite and discrete.
 NOTE: for an analog image: x, y, and intensity of values are continuous.</description>
